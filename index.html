It is celebrated by lighting oil lamps, decorating homes with rangolis, and bursting fireworks. Families worship Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi, seeking prosperity and happiness. The festival brings people together, fostering unity, joy, and kindness. Diwali is marked by the exchange of sweets, gifts, and well-wishes, creating an atmosphere of warmth and togetherness.</p>
